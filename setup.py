    long_description='The chars2vec language model is based on the symbolic representation of words \
                    â€“ the model maps each word to a vector of a fixed length. Model tries map the \
                    most similar words to the most closed vectors. With current approach is possible \
                    to create an embedding in vector space for any sequence of characters. \
                    Chars2vec is based on TensorFlow deep neural network so it does not keep \
                    dictionary of embeddings and generates vector inplace using pretrained model.  \
                    There are pretrained models of dimensions 50, 100 and 150 for the English \
                    language. Library provides convenient user API to train model for arbitrary \
                    set of characters.',
